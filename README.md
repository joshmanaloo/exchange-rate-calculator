The exchange rate calculator is a simple exchange rate calculator based on exchangerate-api.com
The calculator uses ISO 4217 three letter currency codes.

Some work I plan to do on the future include:
* Adding country flags on each currency code to help user determine which currency it states
* Adding a dark mode feature to change theme of the website
* Adding multiple currency views, so that you can check different conversion rates in more than just one country
